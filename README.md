# Jobs dhundo

I have used beautifulSoup library to scrap data from the site. If I have to explain this web scraper(what it does) in simple language it will be as follows:

1)Asked the user which skills he is unfamiliar with.

2)Now, classified the jobs according to their published date(sorted only those which were posted 'few' days ago.)

3)Extracted the company name, required skills and location.

4)Saved this information in text format.
